## Context
This project was made for a High Distinction mark in my [Introduction to Programming](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/study/courses/units/Introduction-to-Programming-COS10009/local) university unit.

The requirement for this project was to follow the [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) paradigm. The only exception was that, for some reason, we were allowed to use classes only to hold data. Methods had to be functions outside of classes.

## Changes since submission
The changes since submitting this project are:
- Moving code out of a single file (since we had to submit the code in one file)
- Fixed error when attempting to save a replay when the `Replays` folder doesn't exist
